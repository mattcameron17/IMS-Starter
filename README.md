This project is an Inventory Management System (IMS) that is used to create and delete, customers, items, and orders. The system is controlled by text using the command line interface (CLI). 

## Getting Started

To get started on your own machine fork the project to your own repository, then use the command git clone, followed by the url of the forked repo.  This will get the project onto your machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
The software required to run this project is as follows:

[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) which is allows us to create an executable jar file.

[MySQLWorkbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) which is used to set up the server and database.

[Java Development Kit](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) which allows us to code Java.

Also an Integrated Development environment is recommended such as [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
